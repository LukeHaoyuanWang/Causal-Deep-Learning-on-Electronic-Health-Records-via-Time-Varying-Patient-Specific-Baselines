    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "    - Determine **Cardiovascular Risk (CVR)**: Sample from a uniform distribution $U(0,1)$. This value is fixed over time.\n",
    "    - Determine **Age**: Start from the patient's 40th birthday.\n",
    "    - Initialize all other events as 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start Simulation:**\n",
    "    - Set the starting day as $\\text{day} = 0$ (the first day).\n",
    "    - Initialize $t_0 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Daily Event Check:**\n",
    "    - When $\\text{day} = t_0$, check todayâ€™s status for the 8 events.\n",
    "    - Only sample the events that are currently 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Define Intensity Parameters:**\n",
    "    - According to the relationships defined in the model, set the **intensity parameters** (rate of the exponential distribution) for the events that are 0.\n",
    "    - Expoential distribution guarantees that events are expected to happen continuously and independently at a constant average rate.\n",
    "    - Intensity scores allow you to model the randomness of when events happen, but in a way that reflects how risky or likely each event is for the patient. \n",
    "    - For the 8 binary variables, each has intensity parameter which is a function of its parents. We assume the time to event follows exponential distribution with parameter determined by current status of a patient.\n",

    "5. **Sample Time to Next Occurrence:**\n",
    "    - For each event that is 0, sample the **time to next occurrence** from the exponential distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Determine Next Event:**\n",
    "    - Identify the next earliest event by finding the smallest sampled time to the event.\n",
    "    - Let this event happen on $\\text{day} = t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Event Occurrence:**\n",
    "    - When $\\text{day} = t$, the picked event occurs (turn it to 1):\n",
    "      1. If it is a **drug**, it stays 365 days (or another specified duration, e.g., 100/60/30 days).\n",
    "      2. If it is a **disease**, it stays for 30 days.\n",
    "      3. If it is **Myocardial Infarction (MI)**, it only happens on that day.\n",
